## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, create an Issue but don't put details that would allow it to be exploited in the Issue. Instead, 
send email with details to steve@epistimis.com

The Issue will be used to track status of the issue. Issues will get the standard SLA, depending on their seriousness.
